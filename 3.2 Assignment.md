# Explain what is GitHub Authentication and how what methods available to be implemented?

GitHub Authentication is a process that allows users to securely access GitHub services and resources by verifying their identity. It ensures that only authorized users can interact with repositories, projects, and other GitHub features. GitHub provides several methods for authentication, each suited to different use cases and security requirements:
You can access your resources in GitHub in a variety of ways: in the browser, via GitHub Desktop or another desktop application, with the API, or via the command line. Each way of accessing GitHub supports different modes of authentication.

1. Username and password with two-factor authentication, or a passkey
2. Personal access token
3. SSH key

4. git commit: Records changes to the repository and creates a new commit.
Usage: git commit -m "Commit message"

5. git push: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
Usage: git push <remote> <branch>

6. git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the local repository.

7. git status: Displays the status of the working directory and staging area.
Usage: git status

8. git branch: Lists, creates, or deletes branches within a repository.
Usage: git branch to list branches, git branch <branchname> to create a new branch, git branch -d <branchname> to delete a branch.

9. git checkout: Switches between branches or restores files in the working directory to their state in a specific commit.
Usage: git checkout <branchname> to switch branches, git checkout <commit> <file> to restore a file to its state in a specific commit.

10. git merge: Combines changes from different branches into the current branch.
Usage: git merge <branchname>

11. git log: Displays a log of commits in reverse chronological order.
Usage: git log

12. git reset: Resets the current HEAD to a specified state and optionally updates the working directory and staging area.
